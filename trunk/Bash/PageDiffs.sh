# PageDiffs: Fill in an array of webpages, with the option "write"
# will download them, with the "diff" option will re-download them and
# check the new against the old for differences. With the "diff mail"
# option, will send an email to $MAILRECIPIENT, assuming mail works.

# 20100818@07:10 Steve Almond from silkandslug.com found & solved a
# sh/bash problem. Suggestion for next revision: emailing diff

# 20100818@07:27 Previous suggestion forced as default. Now there is
# also the diff in the mail. For the next revision, add a command line
# switch to enable/disable it.
